            <p class="sectionsutag text-small">Html is first programming language required to design your website.
                It actually use to structure your website.
                commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Web browsers can
                read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
                website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a
                programming language.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">CSS: Csacading Style Sheet</p>
            <p class="sectionsutag text-small"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used
                to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be
                applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript,
                CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user
                interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML . CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
                Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">JavaScript</p>
            <p class="sectionsutag text-small"> JavaScript is used by almost every website on the internet, so I
                embarked on a quest to find the best active JavaScript blogs for programmers. Each of these sites
                demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and
                has stood the test of time.
                During this process, I used a consistent approach to analyze and compare common qualities (or
                deficiencies) in each blog. I looked at the depth of each blogâ€™s technical content and the usefulness of
                that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and
                comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently each web dev blog publishes new content, and I did some
                digging to learn how long each site has been around. Most of these blogs are similar in that they offer
                in-depth articles on other areas of web development, making them ideal blogs for programmers.
